## What is it
It is an idle clicker web-based game. It uses counters to track money and buttons to increase the counters. Prices of counters increase as the user buys more. Buttons are hidden if the user does not have enough.

## What needs added
Add music and sounds.

The page needs to store cookies so user progress is saved when they leave.

Need to add animation to button like '+1' appearing.

## What needs fixed

Need to remove border round images.

Need to find better images.

Need to stop user being able to TAB onto a button and holding enter.

Need to fix bug where autoclicker stays avaiable for purchase, when the user has not got enough money, until the count goes up by atleast one again.
